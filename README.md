# HOUSING-PRICE-ESTIMATIONS-ON-REAL-ESTATES-IN-AMES-IOWA
Introduction:
Due to the immense housing shortage in many big cities, price estimation of housing is becoming
more relevant. Housing is an extremely expensive part of household expenditure. Furthermore,
the supply of housing cannot adjust to high demands in the short-run. Housing price estimation
methods are useful for the general public and many direct stakeholders in the housing market.
For example, real estate agents, mortgage lenders, brokers, property developers, investors and
prospective homeowners and sellers profit from a price estimation of real estate that is as accurate
as possible. A large amount of existing data on sold real estate properties makes it possible to
develop models to evaluate and predict the sale price of other real estate properties. Many features
can be included in the analyses, for example, living area, number of rooms, geographical location
and year built. Machine learning offers statistical techniques to develop these estimation tools. In
supervised learning, example input data is mapped to corresponding output data. This is useful
in the case of housing price estimation models as there exist datasets including input and output
data observations. Regression methods handle continuous outputs whereas, in classification, input
data is divided into classes. Unseen inputs are assigned to one of these classes by the produced
model. The main objective of this project is to apply several supervised learning methods to create
housing price estimation models.
